PhD-level statistician / data scientist.

I have worked as a statistician for 25 years in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. I have a long history of leading project data handling and analytics, including the management of solutions for robust and secure online data collection. I have published over 150 peer-reviewed articles on a broad range of chronic and infectious diseases. Working with academia, I have secured over 14 million US dollars of funding for health-related research. 

I am committed to open-access data, and am developing an infrastructure for collecting and sharing Caribbean research data. I am statistical editor for the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders group of the Cochrane Collaboration - an international not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare decision-making globally. I work with a range of Caribbean and international agencies involved in health and wellness. 

<!--Collaborations have included The World Health Organization (WHO), The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), The European Union, UNICEF, Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) -->
<!-- Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).-->
